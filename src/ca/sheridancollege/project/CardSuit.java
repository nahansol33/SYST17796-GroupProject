 * hey guys, trust your exams are going on fine.
    Apparently I cant really conclude my part of the code without 
    having some demo code for the other parts. I think the main method 
    will be in the Game class and will need instances of players, card 
    and of course deck. I dont know how we wanna do it but in the mean time, 
    i created a rough code for the required parts. But lets work on our parts asap. 
    Thanks
